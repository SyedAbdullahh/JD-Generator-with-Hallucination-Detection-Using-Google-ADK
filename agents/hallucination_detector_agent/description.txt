Hallucination Detector Agent

This agent reviews generated Job Descriptions and evaluates whether they contain fabricated, unsupported, or speculative information not grounded in the original user prompt.

It ensures reliability, factual consistency, and professional integrity by flagging hallucinated claims, overly specific assumptions, and risky fabricated details.
